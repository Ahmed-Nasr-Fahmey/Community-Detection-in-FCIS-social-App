# Community Detection in FCIS-social App

## Description

The "Community Detection in FCIS-social App" project aims to analyze the social connections between students in the FCIS-social app and identify different communities that form based on shared interests. By examining the friend-relationship graph, this project intends to count the number of distinct communities that have naturally evolved within the app.

## Problem Statement

The primary objective is to explore the social network graph of students in the FCIS-social app and identify different communities that have formed among them. Each community represents a group of students who share similar interests and tend to connect with one another.

## Key Features

- **Community Identification**: Develop an algorithm to analyze the friend-relationship graph and identify distinct communities based on students' shared interests.

- **Graph Analysis**: Implement techniques to explore the connections and relations between different students in the app.

## Implementation

The project involves implementing a single function:

- **CountCommunities**: A method that takes an array of friend-relation edges as input and calculates the number of different communities within the graph.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in the "Community Detection in FCIS-social App" project, participants will achieve the following learning objectives:

- Develop problem-solving skills in graph analysis and community detection.

- Gain experience in designing algorithms to identify and quantify distinct communities within a social network.

- Understand the concept of graph-based clustering and its applications.

## Outcome

Upon completion, participants will have a functional algorithm that showcases their ability to analyze social network graphs and identify different communities. This project emphasizes skills in algorithmic thinking, graph theory, and data structure manipulation, which are valuable in various domains such as social network analysis, marketing, and recommendation systems.
