# Community Detection in FCIS-social App
 The "Community Detection in FCIS-social App" project aims to analyze the social connections between students in the FCIS-social app and identify different communities that form based on shared interests. By examining the friend-relationship graph, this project intends to count the number of distinct communities that have naturally evolved within the app.
